# TODO:
# - faster build by using lisp with preloaded asdf?
# - dont include java libs unless abcl?
# - dont use build-asdf-system to build lispWithPackages?
# - make the lisp packages overridable? (e.g. buildInputs glibc->musl)
# - build asdf with nix and use that instead of one shipped with impls
#   (e.g. to fix build with clisp - does anyone use clisp?)
# - claspPackages ? (gotta package clasp with nix first)
# - hard one: remove unrelated sources ( of systems not being built)
# - figure out a less awkward way to patch sources
#   (have to build from src directly for SLIME to work, so can't just patch sources in place)
